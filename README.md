# CardSwipe

This is a library based [off of this blog post](https://medium.com/@phillfarrugia/building-a-tinder-esque-card-interface-5afa63c6d3db) that was originally developed for [StudySwipe](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/studyswipe/id1470980976) during Lambda School's 2019 Summer Hackathon.

Feel free to take it and use it however you'd like and if you find any bugs or have some useful way to extend the functionality please make a pull request.
